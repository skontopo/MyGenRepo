It is not the role of the alternative name property to record nick names, pet names or other 'familiar names' that will be of no consequence in public sector data exchange. Furthermore, some individuals have more than one legal name in which case the full name property should be used multiple times. Alternative name gives a means of recording names by which an individual is generally known, or professionally known, even though such names are no more than secondary from a legal point of view."

Providing a simple country name is problematic and should be avoided whereas using a standardised system that allows the use of a code list for country names has a lot of potential for increasing semantic interoperability. Known diversity that one has to deal with when exchanging country names between different communication partners without relying on an agreed code list are: (a) long form vs. short form of a country name (e.g. Federal Republic of Germany vs. Germany), (b) different languages (Italy vs. Italia), (c) historic name vs. current name (Burma vs. Myanmar), (d) ambiguity of similar sounding countries (Republic of the Congo vs. Democratic Republic of the Congo). The Publications Office of the European Union recommends and uses ISO 3166-1 codes for countries in all cases except two: use 'UK' in preference to the ISO 3166 code GB for the United Kingdom; use 'EL' in preference to the ISO 3166 code GR for Greece.

            "note": "It can be equal to or different from a Person's birth name. The birth name is used as a legal term, whereas the full name just gives a representation of the complete name of a Person.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nIn addition to the content of given name, family name and, in some systems, patronymic name, this can carry additional parts of a person's name such as titles, middle names or suffixes like \"the third\" or names which are neither a given nor a family name. The full name is the most reliable label for an individual and as such its use is strongly encouraged, irrespective of whether that name is broken down using the more granular elements.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nIt is anticipated that some systems will only provide or process the full name of a person. Where an individual has more than one full legal name (a relatively rare but not unknown phenomenon), the full name property can be used more than once. In this case, however, the granular name elements should not be used since the intention is that these provide a breakdown of the full name and it will not be clear of which full name this is true. Note that the vocabulary provides an alternative name property. This allows name(s) to be recorded that have no legal status but that nevertheless are the names by which an individual is generally known.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nA name usually sticks with a person for a long time period. In some European countries a name may only be changed according to certain laws and life events, e.g. marriage. The name denominates a natural person even if he/she changes their address. Documents like birth certificate or diploma usually don't carry an address but always the name. Thus the name is one of the core attributes. However it is not sufficient to identify a person since there are combinations of very common names like Smith in the UK, Meier in Germany, or Li in China."
